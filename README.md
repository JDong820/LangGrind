LangGrind
=========

Toolkit to aid all the grindy parts of learning new languages. Keep track of
personal progress and identify areas to spend more time on. Language aquisition
software is a generally a joke, thus this project is not meant to provide
direct means for language aquisition, but to provide efficient memorization
exercises with progress markers and gamification.

tl;dr fun exercises with minimal critical thinking.
